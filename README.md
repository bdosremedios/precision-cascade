UBC M.Sc. Computer Science thesis project creating a HPC GPU-accelerated implementation of a mixed-precision restarted GMRES algorithm variant, where precision is tightened periodically from half to single to double (precision cascades from high speed to low speed but also from lesser accuracy to greater accuracy). The major idea behind this algorithm is that the bottlenecking of precision limitations does not rear it's major effects until reaching changes in the solution that are of corresponding magnitude to the precision limitation, so it would be prudent for efficiency to use cheaper precision computations at the beginning of the iterations, but more expensive accurate ones at the end where precision limitations are more important. This is able to counter standard thinking of precision regarding Krylov subspace methods, where standard thinking is that high to low precision is best, from the fact that the restarting property circumvents ill effects from inaccurate initial Krylov subspace construction since the subspace is forgotten on each reset.

Implementation has been constructed for numerical experimentation as well as for the display of best practices for the implementation of a general cascading precision algorithm. Major numerical experimentation will test the precision-cascading restarted GMRES against standard fixed double precision GMRES and will test differences in accuracy as properties of the linear system are altered. Code is created primarily in C++ with CUDA for gpu acceleration, MATLAB for matrix csv creation, and Python for data visualization.

Heavy inspiration for this variant algorithm and thesis idea comes from Lindquist et al. 2022 (doi: 10.1109/TPDS.2021.3090757) and Zhao et al. 2022 (doi: 10.2197/ipsjjip.30.525), please see those papers and those authors work for more inspiration. Also more generally of mixed precision algorithms from Higham and Mary 2022 (doi: 10.1017/S0962492922000022).
